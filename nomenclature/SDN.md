# Systematic Dozenal Nomenclature

See http://www.dozenal.org/drupal/sites_bck/default/files/DSA_kodegadulo_sdn.pdf

##  Roots:
0.  nil
1. un
2. bi
3. tri
4. quad
5. pent
6. hex
7. sept
8. oct
9. enn
10. dec
11. lev

With these roots we can represent any whole number just by stringing them together.
e.g.:

1. 123  -> unbitri
2. XE6  -> declevhex

We can also use the -dit- syllable to represent a decimal point:

* 3.1415 -> trididunquadunpent

We can represent fractions by using the -per- syllable:

2/3 -> bipertri

If "per" is at the beginning, we assume the numerator to be 1:

1/3 -> pertri
1/5 -> perpent

For generic/unspecified/ambiguous numbers, we can also use the particle -what-

e.g. triperwhat-  would be "3 per something", etc.

* Multiplier prefixes:

These are formed from adding either an "i", "a", "ea", or and "na" to the end
of a number specified with the roots above.  The first 10 of these are:

* nili (0x)
* uni (1x)
* bina (2x)
* trina (3x)
* quadra, quadri (4x)
* penta (5x)
* hexa (6x)
* septa (7x)
* octa (8x)
* ennea (9x)
* deca(Xx)
* leva(Ex)

If the prefix is being attached to a word which begins with a vowel, the final vowel of the prefix can be elided.  e.g.
* --ennium, as in "milennium".   If we prefixed -ennium with quadra, it would become "quadrennial".

In the case of "bina-" and "trina-", the added syllable can sometimes be ommitted:
* --ocular + bina- = "binocular"
* -cycle + bina- = "bicycle"

The point is to make the prefixes easy to say and use.  


We can form multipliers of any whole number this way.  e.g. a 123-sided figure would be a unbitrihedron. 
Note the digits catinated this way do not multiply each other.  They just specify place values in a dozenal
whole number.


* Power Prefixes

* Positive (and zero) powers of 10 are expressed with a -qua ending on the prefix:

* nilqua- (10^0 x)
* unqua- (10^1 x)
* biqua (10^2 x)
* triqua (10^3 x)
* quadqua (10^4 x)
* pentqua (10^5 x)
* hexqua (10^6 x)
* septqua- (10^7 x)
* octqua- (10^8 x)
* ennqua- (10^9 x)
* decqua- (10^X x)
* lefqua- (10^E x)

* Positive (and zero) powers of 10 are expressed with a -qua ending on the prefix:

* nilcia- (10^-0 x)
* unqua- (10^1 x)
* biqua (10^2 x)
* triqua (10^3 x)
* quadqua (10^4 x)
* pentqua (10^5 x)
* hexqua (10^6 x)
* septqua- (10^7 x)
* octqua- (10^8 x)
* ennqua- (10^9 x)
* decqua- (10^X x)
* lefqua- (10^E x)

Higher orders of magnidude are formed by the whole number + qua or cia .e.g.
* 10^123 x would be unbitriqua-
* 10^XE would be declevqua

* Combinting multiplier and power prefixes:

We can string both multiplier and power prefixes together.  e.g.
* 200,000  --> binapentqua-

Don't confuse this with bipentqua- which would be 10^25 x.

If the multiplier ends with a vowel and the power prefix begins with a vowel, then it can be hard to pronounce.
So optionally, you can put an -n- between them, e.g.:

*  2 * 10^1 = 20 -> binaunqua-  could also be bunanunqua-

* General form:

(number1 -a-) number2 -qua | -cia  

where -a- means you might want to put na-, and -qua and -cia mean you might wnat to add other euphonizers.  

Not that hard.  And very useful.
